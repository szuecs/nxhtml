This is a patched version of [nxhtml](http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html) version 2.08.
To get rid of warnings I patched all files to get a working nxhtml running on latest Emacs (24.3).
To get rid of warnings that are not patched, just include a [config-patch](https://github.com/szuecs/emacs-starter-kit/blob/sandor/sszuecs/workaround-mumamo-buffer-file-name-warnings.el) into your emacs config.

[Original README.txt](https://github.com/szuecs/nxhtml/blob/master/README.txt)

There is an [ongoing development version of nxhtml](https://github.com/emacsmirror/nxhtml) which you may want to use instead of this one.
